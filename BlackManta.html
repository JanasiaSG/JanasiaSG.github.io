    <h1>BLACK MANTA</h1>
    <p>LOATHSOMENESS WAITS AND DREAMS IN THE DEEP, AND DECAY SPEADS OVER THE TOTTERING CITIES OF MEN.</p>
    <p>David Milton Hyde was the son of Jesse Hyde and his wife, Ramona Hyde-Montez. It was revealed that David and his family are descendents of the Deseter Kingdom, which is one of the kingdoms of Atlantis and this kingdom originated in Africa. This kingdom left Atlantis and returned to Africa before Atlantis sank.
      This was the only kingdom that escaped the sinking of Atlantis, but unfortunately, this kingdom perished. Since this kingdom escaped the sinking of Atlantis (known as the Great Deluge), they and thei descendents did not evolve and gain the powers and abilities of other Atlanteans.
      David and his father, Jesse lived on a boat known as the Black Manta. David worked as a treasure hunter and diver for his father. Some time later, a marine biologist named Stephen Shin contacted him so that he can get a sampel of Arthur Curry's blood, so that Shin could prove that Arthur was an Atlantean.
      Arthur's father, Thomas defended his son, but he had a heart attack and died three days later. During the day of his father's funeral, Arthur was angry and stormed on the boat that belonged to David and his father. Arthur then killed Jesse, believing Jesse to be responsible for his father's death. Years passed, and when Arthur became known as Aquaman,
      David became Black Manta to exact vengeance for his father's murder.</p>
      <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
      <p>David Hyde has a son with a woman named Lucia, a woman from the Kingdom of Xebel, one of the kingdoms of Atlantis. Their son was named Jackson Hyde (also known as Kaldur'ahm in the New Earth Continuity[After 1985 crisis but before 2011 Flashpoint Event][the present continuity in DC is Prime Earth]).
        Jackson is the protege of Aquaman and was Aqualad for a time. He recently took up his mentor's mantle and is now Aquaman as well.</p>
