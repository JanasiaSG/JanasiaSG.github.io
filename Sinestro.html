    <h1>SINESTRO</h1>
      <p>IN BLACKEST DAY, IN BRIGHTEST NIGHT, BEWARE YOUR FEARS MADE INTO LIGHT. LET THOSE WHO TRY TO STOP WHAT'S RIGHT, BURN LIKE HIS POWER! SINESTRO'S MIGHT!</p>
        <p>The Sinestro Corps or Yellow Lanterns are lanterns who wield a yellow power ring that is powered by fear. Sinestro is the founder of this corps and is one of the main enemies of Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps.
          Thaal Sinestro was born on the planet Korugar, which is a part of Sector 1417. He was married to a woman named Arin Sur and they had a daughter named Soranik Sinestro (her legal name is Soranik Natu). Soranik was once a Green Lantern, but she joined her father's corps as a Yellow Lanter. When he grew up, he became a Green Lantern and was one of the best and most powerful among them. He was abusive with his power and decided that he could turn Korugar into his own version of paradise. He felt that fear was more effective to bring order to the cosmos than willpower. He felt that he knew better than the Guardians of Oa. Sinestro then became a Yellow Lantern after journeying to the Anti-Matter Universe and made a deal with the Weaponers of Qward. He was given a yellow lantern power battery and ring and founded his own Corps. </p>
          <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
          <p>Sinestro's wife was Arin Sur, who was the sister of Abin Sur. Abin Sur was the Green Lantern that Hal Jordan came into contact with, which led Hal to become a Green Lantern</p>
