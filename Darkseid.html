          <h1>DARKSEID</h1>
        <p>I HAVE TURNED 100,000 WORLDS TO DUST LOOKING FOR ANTI-LIFE. LOOKING FOR THOSE WHO ROBBED ME OF MY GLORY. I WILL STRIDE ACROSS THEIR BONES AND BASK IN THE GLOW OF ANTI-LIFE. AND ALL OF EXISTENCE WILL BE MINE!</p>
        <p>There are different origins depending on the continuity. This origin will be from the New 52 era (2011-beginning of 2016) and the recent era of DC Comics.
          Before he was known as Darkseid, he was Uxas and lived in the days of the Old Gods. The Old Gods included the Greek Gods and other gods throughout the DC Universe such as Atlantean, Apokoliptian anothers. Uxas was the brother in law of Izaya for he was married to Uxas' sister, Avia.
          Uxas made no secret of his hatred of the gods and sought to destroy them. Uxas decided to climb the Forbidden Mountain and caused them to turn on each other. After all was said and done, Darkseid killed one of the Old Gods and became the first being to kill an Old God. He gained his powers and increased them as he slaughtered more of them.
          During the battles, his sister was wounded, but he did not care. Her husband, Izaya tried to save her but it was too late. He later gained the powers of an Old God when one of them was killed near him. With his powers, he tried to stop his brother in law, but it didn't work. Darkseid and Izaya battled and the results of this caused the planet they were on to split at the seams and became seperate planets. One became Apokolips and the other became New Genisis. The planets were in close proximity to the Source, which was thought to the source of all that existed in the DC Universe such as Creation of the Mutliverse, and others. The beings of Apokolips and New Gensis may resemble humans but they are immortal, stronger, faster, and smarter as well as coupled with an array of powers and abilities.</p>
          <p>Darkseid has 3 known biological sons named Kalibak, Orion, and Grayven as well as a daughter named Grail, a hybrid of Amazon and New God as well as an adopted son named Scott Free, who is known as Mister Miracle and is the biological son of Izaya. Izaya and Darkseid exchanged their sons and Orion was given to Izaya, while Scott was given to Darksied. Darkseid has a team of powerful ranking members known as Darkseid's Elite. They were the ones who supported him and were loyal to his reign. It consists of: Granny Goodness, Steppenwolf, Desaad, Kalibak, and Kanto along with some others. There is also an elite fighting force known as the Female Furies and that is run by Granny Goodness. One of the most powerful warriors on the team is Barda Free, who is known as Big Barda. She defected and married Scott, but unfortunately she rejoined the Female Furies because of a deal that was made during the events of The Darkseid War, but she is no longer a villain.</p>
