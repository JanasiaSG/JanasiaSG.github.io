  <h1>THE FLASH</h1>
<p>MY NAME IS BARRY ALLEN AND I AM THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE.</p>
<p>Barry Allen is the son of Henry and Nora Allen. As a child, he witnessed his mother's murder at the hands of Eobard Thawne. At the time, he did not know who Thawne was and Thawne framed Henry for the murder of his wife.
  Henry was sentenced to life in prision in Iron Heights and there was no evidence to prove Henry's innocence. Years later, Barry become a CSI at the Central City Police Department and was struck by lightning some time later.
  When he was struck by lightning, it doused the chemicals that Barry was next to and he gained a connection to the Speed Force. As The Flash, he saved lives and was a superhero. He then learned the truth about his mother's murder
  and encountered Eobard Thawne, the Reverse Flash. Barry learned that Thawne murdered his mother in a game of revenge in reverse. Sometime, Eobard was imprisoned in Iron Heights and Barry proved his father's innocence.
  During his time as the Flash, he learned more about the Speed Force and started to have proteges such as Wally West and Wallace West and had a team of his own known as the Flash Family. This family includes speedsters and Iris West.
  Some speedsters in the Flash Family were erased from the timeline and were trapped in the Speed Force, but Barry recently took them out of it. This was due to the changes in the timeline such as Flashpoint (Read DC Flashpoint, 2011) which led to 10 years of time taken from Barry's and other heroes lives.
  Some were erased from the timeline such as Wally West, Jesse Quick, Max Mercury and Jay Garrick. </p>
  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
  <p>Barry and Iris have twins named Don and Dawn Allen, but they originate in the timeline before Flashpoint. They are known as the Tornado Twins and were supervillains due to Thawne's machinations.
They were restored to their proper time.<p>
<p>Johhny Quick and Jay Garrick hail from the Golden Age of Comics (1930s-1956).</p>
<p>Jesse Quick is the daughter of Johnny Quick and his wife, who were Golden Age Superheroes</p>
<p> Barry Allen and Wally West are the fastest men in the DC Universe.</p>
