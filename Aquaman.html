    <h1>Aquaman</h1>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>Athur Curry is the son of Thomas Curry and Atlanna, Queen of Atlantis. He was born and raised in Amnesty Bay with his father, unaware of his royal Atlantean lineage.
      Years later, he married Mera, pricess of Xebel and is his queen. They have a daughter named Andrina Curry (Andy for short). Arthur has an Atlantean name which is Orin and he has a younger half-brother named Orm Marius. It wasn't until Arthur became aware of who he was when he met Orm. Arthur was the rightful king of Atlantis and Orm resented him for it. Orm thought he was doing what was best for his people, but he willingly tried to drown the surface. Arthur had no choice but to stop him.
    To defeat his brother, Arthur had to take up the throne and become King. Arthur never wanted the throne, but he tried his best to make peace between land and sea. During his reign as king over 70% of the Earth (his domian is all of the oceans and all of Atlantis), he also spent his time on the surface as one of the founding members of the Justice League.</p>
