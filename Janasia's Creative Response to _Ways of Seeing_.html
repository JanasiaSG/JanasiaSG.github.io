       I learned about how we view paintings through different lenses. One lense that I liked was Perspective Vision. This intrigued me because we can look at paintings through our own lenses such as perspective or personal experiences. This can relate to how we can see through the eyes of another (the other person's views or opinions), or even through the simple and complex lenses of technology.
       I also learned about the different ways that we are affected when we look at an image, and I never really paid any attention to those aspects/assumptions because I would usually look at teh painting and pull clues from it. Those mentioned were taste, beauty, genius, civilization, truth, and form. The book also wrote about perpsective in terms of how European art was seen in the past and now. It states, "Today we see the art of the past as nobody saw it before. We actually perceive it in a different way.This difference can be illustrated in terms of what was thought-of as perspective. The convention of perspective, which is unique to European art and which was first established in the early Renaissance, centres everything on the eye of the beholder". This is an example of how complex and simple European art can be. The artwork may be portraying something simple as a portrait and people of that era didn't really need to find a meaning, but today, we are always looking for a message or interpretation or meaning of the painting, and each of us have our opinions as to what they are.
