  They discovered Kal-El and decided to take him in. They raised him as their own son, naming him , Clark Joseph Kent. Growing up in Smallville, he had a best friend named Lana Lang and during that time, he was unaware of his Kryptonian heritage until his parents showed him his ship.
  Years later, he got a job as a reporter at the Daily Planet in Metropolis. There he met Perry White, Jimmy Olsen, and his love interest and wife, Lois Lane. He also has a son named Jonathan Kent, who was Superboy, and currently uphold's his father's mantle of Superman. Kal-El is a fouding member of the Justice League and has his own team-up of sorts with Batman, known as The World's Finest as well as a team known as the Superman Family.
