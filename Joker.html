    <h1>The Joker</h1>
    <p>There is really no definitve origin of The Joker and his known canon origin story is from from Batman: Three Jokers. Before he became the Joker, he was a failing stand-up comedian and was married to a woman named Jeannie and she was pregnant.
      Joker became mentally erratic and difficult and Jeannie was afraid. She contacted the police and they helped her to fake her death and she then moved to Alaska. Joker was led to believe that his wife and unborn child were dead and he never knew the truth.
      Throughout his life of crime, fighting with the Batman, he was constantly in Arkham Asylum and escaping. He had a known sidekick/partner name Harley Quinn. She was a psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum and worked with the Joker. She fell in love with him.
      Currently, she left him and is no longer a supervillian, but she is an anti-hero/neutral and works with the Bat-Family at times. Another one of Gotham's villains have reformed, and that is Poisoon Ivy. </p>
