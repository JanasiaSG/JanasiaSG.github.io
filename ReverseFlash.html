      <h1>REVERSE FLASH</h1>
      <p>OH, I'M NOT LIKE THE FLASH AT ALL. SOME WOULD SAY I'M THE REVERSE.</p>
      <p>Eobard Thawne hails from the 25th Century and was a HUGE fan of The Flash and obsessed with him, especially Barry Allen. He was the curator of the Flash Museum.
      He was so obsessed, that he replicated the accident that gave Barry his powers and Thawne then gained access to the Speed Force. He travelled through time, but then he learned that he was destined to be his enemy and grew to resent him. He then created his own Speed Force, called the Negative Speed Force.
    He decided to kill Barry, but when he tried, he was being erased from existance. He learned that Barry must be protected at all costs so that he could live; the man he hates more than anything has to live. He figured out a way to torment Barry and make him suffer and he did so by travelling through time and murdering Nora Allen, then framing her husband for her murder.
    Years later, after Barry defeated Thawne and was imprisoned in Iron Heights, he was struck by a bolt of lightning, which restored his memories from the Flashpoint Event and before (Read The Flash Rebirth issue #19: Sins of the Father, which is included in the graphic novel, Flash Rebirth vol 3: Rogues Reloaded and Batman The Flash: The Button).
    Thawne was soon ressurected and restored after the events of Batman The Flash: The Button due to his connection to the Negative Speed Force. Thawne is essentailly a living paradox, for he can manipulate the timeline to get what he wants and to torment Barry and the rest of the Flash Family. During the events of The Flash Rebirth Vol 15: Finish Line, Barry eventually forgives Thawne and grounds him to time, thus restoring Eobard to his proper timeline and forgetting everything. </p>
