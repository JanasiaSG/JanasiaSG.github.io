As I read some of the book, one statement stood out to me. It stated, 'All media are extensions of some human faculty-psychic or physical'. The book then gives examples of how technology and innovation are extensions of us whether through physical forms or mentally. One example shown in the book is an image of a wheel, with the caption that says.'...is an extension of the foot.'This shows how the invention of the wheel has taken inspiration from our feet as it enables us to move and travel, therefore, the wheel travels and can go farther in distance and used in different vechicles for travel. After reading some of the book, I figured out that there was an example of this statement above. The example that I thought of was computers and coding. Humans invented computers and created computer programming languages to communicate with the computers. We created the technology, but the invention can accomplish what we could, but at an atonishing and fast speeds. They are extensions of our brains, in a way, because they can solve problems like we can, but only using alogrithims and logic. Our brains can do the same as well, but we also use emotions and opinions, while technology cannot accomplish this.");
